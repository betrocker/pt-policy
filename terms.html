    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <small>Last updated: 2025-12-21</small>

    <p>
      These Terms of Service (“Terms”) apply to your use of the PerfectTrade
      mobile application (“App”). By installing or using the App, you agree to
      these Terms. If you do not agree, please do not use the App.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Purpose of the App</h2>
    <p>
      PerfectTrade is designed as a trading journal and performance tracking
      tool. It helps you record trades, checklists, notes, and statistics to
      support your own decision‑making process.
    </p>
    <p>
      The App does <strong>not</strong> provide personalized financial advice,
      trading signals, or recommendations to buy or sell any financial
      instruments.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Premium Features &amp; Billing</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Some features (for example, advanced analytics or custom checklists) may require a paid subscription (“Premium”).</li>
      <li>Payments and subscriptions are handled by the App Store / Google Play, not directly by us.</li>
      <li>
        Subscriptions may renew automatically unless you cancel them in your
        store account settings before the renewal date.
      </li>
      <li>
        Any free trial, pricing, or duration of Premium may change over time
        according to store rules and our configuration.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>You agree that you will not:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the App for any illegal or unauthorized purpose.</li>
      <li>Attempt to disrupt, hack, or overload our servers or services.</li>
      <li>
        Reverse engineer, copy, or redistribute the App except where allowed by
        applicable law.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use the App to store or share content that is unlawful, abusive,
        harmful, or violates the rights of others.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Trading &amp; Risk Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>
      Trading and investing in financial instruments (such as stocks, forex,
      crypto, or derivatives) involves risk, including the risk of losing some
      or all of your capital.
    </p>
    <p>
      The App is for journaling, tracking, and educational purposes only. It
      should <strong>not</strong> be treated as financial, investment, legal, or
      tax advice. Any decisions you make based on your own trading data,
      statistics, or notes are your sole responsibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Past performance, statistics, or patterns recorded in the App do not
      guarantee future results.
    </p>

    <h2>5. No Warranty</h2>
    <p>
      The App is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis, without any
      warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, to the fullest extent
      permitted by law. We do not guarantee that the App will be error‑free,
      uninterrupted, or always available.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      To the fullest extent allowed by law, we are not liable for any indirect,
      incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of
      profits, data, or trading capital related to your use of (or inability to
      use) the App.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are responsible for backing up your own information and for verifying
      any data before relying on it in trading or investment decisions.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Changes to the App and Terms</h2>
    <p>
      We may update or change the App, add or remove features, or modify these
      Terms from time to time. If we make important changes, we may notify you
      within the App or by other reasonable means. Continued use of the App
      after changes means you accept the updated Terms.
    </p>
