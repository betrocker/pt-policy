    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <small>Last updated: 2025-12-21</small>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how PerfectTrade (“we”, “us”) handles
      information when you use the PerfectTrade mobile application (“App”).
      Using the App means you agree to this Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information You Enter</h2>
    <p>Depending on how you use the App, you may enter:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Trade entries, results, and journal notes.</li>
      <li>Tags, checklists, rules, and screenshots related to your trades.</li>
      <li>Other text you manually add inside the App.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This information is primarily used to help you track and analyze your own
      trading performance.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Account &amp; Subscription Data</h2>
    <p>
      If you create an account or use Premium features, we may process
      information such as:

      <li>Your subscription status (active, expired, trial, etc.).</li>
      <li>Basic billing metadata from the App Store / Google Play (we do not handle full payment details ourselves).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Information Collected Automatically</h2>
    <p>To keep the App reliable and improve it over time, we may collect:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Basic technical data (e.g. device model, OS version, app version).</li>
      <li>Crash logs and performance diagnostics.</li>
      <li>
        Simple usage information (for example, which screens are used most), in
        aggregated or anonymized form where possible.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>We may use the information described above to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide and operate the core journaling and analytics features.</li>
      <li>Enable and manage Premium subscriptions.</li>
      <li>Find and fix bugs, improve performance, and plan new features.</li>
      <li>Respond to support requests and communicate with you if needed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Sharing of Information</h2>
    <p>
      We do not sell your personal information. We may share limited data with:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Service providers that help us operate the App (for example,
        authentication, databases, analytics, crash reporting, or
        subscription/billing validation).
      </li>
      <li>
        Authorities or third parties when required by law or to protect our
        legal rights.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      We keep your information only as long as needed for the purposes described
      in this Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or allowed by
      law (for example, for legal, accounting, or security reasons).
    </p>

    <h2>7. Your Choices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You can stop using the App at any time. If you uninstall the App, local
        data on your device may be deleted.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the App uses cloud sync or online backup, you may contact us to ask
        about deletion of stored data where applicable.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can manage and cancel subscriptions in your App Store / Google Play
        account settings.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Children</h2>
    <p>
      The App is not directed to children under the age required by applicable
      laws to give valid consent (for example, 13 or 16). If you believe a child
      has provided us with personal information, please contact us so we can
      take appropriate action.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make important
      changes, we may notify you in the App or by other reasonable means.
      Continued use of the App after changes means you accept the updated
      Policy.
